CouchBooks sample application

This app is a blatant copy of the CoreDataBooks application which uses the
Couchbase Mobile for iOS and the couchbase_ti module for data storage.  The
original CoreDataBooks app can be found here:

This sample illustrates how to initialize a CouchDb database, load default
data and design documents, and populate Titanium UI objects with data from
CouchDb.  It includes a CommonJS module that provides a more database-like
interface on top of the asynchronous HTTP calls that are used to access
CouchDb.

In order to run this example, you must have installed the couchbase_ti module
according to the instructions found on Github here:

  https://github.com/pegli/couchbase_ti/wiki/Using-couchbase_ti

Feel free to log issues with this application on the couchbase_ti Github project.

Time to relax!
